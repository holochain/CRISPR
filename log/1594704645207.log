Tracks are played by Unity for the players using the tracklist and the MIDI messags from the DJ. All messages are saved into the DHT as well as being direct messages (possibly WebRTC). Live performance can be replayed and track artists get paid using info such as how much of the track was played.","order":0}},"url":"ws://localhost:33000","timestamp":1594704645207}
